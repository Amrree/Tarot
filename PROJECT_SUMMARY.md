# Tarot Studio - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

I've successfully built **Tarot Studio**, a comprehensive native macOS Tarot reading application with AI integration, inspired by the sleek dark terminal-style aesthetics of "Zed." The application is fully functional, production-ready, and includes all requested features.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- **Complete 78-card Rider-Waite deck** with upright and reversed meanings
- **Card influence engine** that computes how neighboring cards modify meanings
- **AI-powered interpretations** via local Ollama LLM
- **Native macOS interface** using PyObjC with dark theme
- **Local-first data storage** with SQLite and encryption
- **Conversational AI** with memory system for context recall

### User Interface
- **Clean, modern design** with dark terminal-style aesthetics
- **Sidebar navigation** with icons and subtle text
- **Readings tab** with draw panel, card display, and interpretation
- **Chat tab** for AI conversations with context awareness
- **History tab** for browsing past readings with search
- **Settings tab** for configuration and preferences

### Technical Implementation
- **Modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive test suite** with unit and integration tests
- **Production-ready packaging** with py2app for macOS .app
- **Developer documentation** and user guides
- **Error handling** and fallback mechanisms

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The application follows the requested design principles:

- **Dark terminal aesthetics** inspired by Zed editor
- **Monospaced typography** for clean, functional appearance
- **Minimalist interface** with generous padding and clean lines
- **Cyan-blue accents** for highlights and active states
- **No mystical imagery** - purely functional and elegant
- **Native macOS integration** with proper dark mode support

## 🔧 Key Components

### 1. Card Influence Engine
- **Rule-based system** for computing card interactions
- **Major Arcana dominance** (1.5x multiplier)
- **Suit interactions** (Cups soften Swords, etc.)
- **Numeric progressions** for sequential cards
- **Adjacency effects** based on spread positions
- **Reversal propagation** for inverted cards

### 2. AI Integration
- **Ollama client** for local LLM communication
- **Structured JSON responses** for consistent UI rendering
- **Streaming support** for real-time updates
- **Conversation memory** with semantic search
- **Context awareness** for personalized responses

### 3. Memory System
- **Semantic storage** of entities, people, and concepts
- **Importance scoring** and decay over time
- **Context-aware retrieval** for AI conversations
- **Entity extraction** from readings and conversations

### 4. Database Layer
- **SQLAlchemy models** for all data structures
- **SQLite backend** for local storage
- **Encryption support** for sensitive data
- **Migration system** for schema updates

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:

- **Influence engine** with various card combinations
- **AI client** with mocked Ollama responses
- **Memory system** with entity storage and retrieval
- **Database operations** with CRUD functionality
- **Error handling** and edge cases

Run tests with:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## 📦 Packaging

The application is packaged as a native macOS .app using py2app:

- **Native bundle** with proper Info.plist
- **Dark theme** by default
- **Code signing** support
- **DMG creation** for distribution
- **Dependency management** with proper exclusions

Build with:
```bash
./tarot_studio/packaging/build_app.sh
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS 10.15+ (Catalina or later)
- Python 3.10+
- Ollama (for AI features)

### Installation
1. **Install Ollama**: Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. **Pull a model**: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. **Start Ollama**: `ollama serve`
4. **Build the app**: `./tarot_studio/packaging/build_app.sh`
5. **Launch**: Open `dist/Tarot Studio.app`

### Usage
1. **Draw cards** in the Readings tab
2. **Chat with AI** about your readings
3. **Browse history** of past readings
4. **Configure settings** for AI and appearance
